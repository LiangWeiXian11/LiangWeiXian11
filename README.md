### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weixian Liang. 

I am currently working on my master degree, Urban Spatial Science in University College of London <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.interdisciplinaryitaly.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ucl-logo.png" width="17"/>. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Geographic Information Science from South China Agricultural University and am interested in smart cities, data-driven decision making, and other future urban developments.:blush:

I will use Github to shore and display my learning notes, assignments, and projects. There are some useful links:

- (more contents are coming!)
