### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weixian Liang. 

I am currently looking for job opportunities as a Product Manager, Project Manager, Map Engineer, Data Analyst and so on. 
I have a mester degree, Urban Spatial Science in University College of London <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.interdisciplinaryitaly.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ucl-logo.png" width="17"/>, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Geographic Information Science (GIS) from South China Agricultural University. 
I am also interested in discussing smart cities, data-driven decision making, and other topics for future urban development. ðŸ˜€

I will use Github to shore and display my learning notes, assignments, and projects. There are some useful links:
